Wreaths with daisies in them were thrown on (thatched) roofs on June 24 to protect the house or farm against lightning and fire. They were also used as oracle flowers for questions about the course of life and love. Saint Margaret, after whom "Marguerite" is named, lived at the end of the 3rd century in Antioch (later Syria), where her nurse educated in the Christian doctrine. Faced with the choice between marrying a pagan citizen or becoming his slave, she rejected both options. After torture, she was handed over to the devil, who swallowed her disguised as a dragon. By making the sign of the cross, she was able to escape unharmed from his stomach, as if it were a prosperous delivery. Before she was then beheaded, she begged pregnant women to give birth to a healthy child. Besides a dragon, Margarita is also depicted with a pearl necklace, a sign of innocence and virginity (Gr. margaritis = pearl). She is one of the fourteen emergency helpers and assists midwives and nurses.
