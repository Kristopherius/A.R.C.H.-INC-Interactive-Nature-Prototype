This plant is also known as Banlangen, and is used as an herbal medicinal tea in China for colds and tonsular ailments. Used as a tea, it has a brownish appearance and (unlike most Chinese medicines) is mildly sweet in taste.
This plant has been used as far back as the time of the ancient Egyptians, who used it to dye the cloth wrappings applied for the mummies. A natural indigo dye can be extracted from the plant.
